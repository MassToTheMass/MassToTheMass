After running the programming you are given a couple options:

Create - Asks you for a couple details relating to the race
        This information can be retrieved in a later action
        The only propting that requires proper spelling is the text file
        With improper spelling this won't return any actual results

Meet - Asks you for the name of the meet, you will need proper spelling
        To find names of meets already in the database refer to all meets
        Meet will return you a list of everyone in order for the race

All Meets - This simply returns the name of every meet that exists in the database
            This will also include any other meets you add
        
Athlete - This will ask you for the name of the athlete
        After typing the name of an athlete that exists in the database
        you will be given their name, grade, team and records.

        grade, team, and records are not currently stored
        so there won't be any information returned for those fields

        Assuming you enter the name that a couple people share you will
        be given a simple outline of each person then propted to pick one
        the one you choose will then give you the more detailed information

All Athletes - This returns everyone's basic outline with name, team, and grade
                As mentioned previously team and grade have no data

Quit - This will simply quit the program
